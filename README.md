# ☕ Power BI Capstone Project – Coffee Quality Analysis

This project explores the key factors influencing **Arabica coffee quality** using a dataset of global coffee reviews. Through **interactive dashboards in Power BI**, we analyze sensory attributes, processing methods, defect rates, and origin countries to identify what contributes most to a high-quality cup of coffee.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Determine how attributes like aroma, acidity, and aftertaste affect coffee quality
- Examine how **processing methods and origin countries** impact quality scores
- Identify patterns in **defect occurrences** and their effect on cup scores
- Visualize **overall quality distribution** across regions and processes

---

## 📊 Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop**
- Data transformation using Power Query Editor
- DAX for calculated columns and measures

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Sensory attributes** like aroma, balance, and aftertaste strongly correlate with quality category
- **Washed/Wet** and **Natural/Dry** processing methods consistently score higher
- Countries like **Ethiopia, Colombia, and Guatemala** show higher cup scores
- Higher **defect counts** negatively impact overall quality even in good sensory scoring samples
